# Eve_Sensor_Dampening_Calculator
Evesensordampeningcalculator
All this is is a simple dampening calculator that I might add a target painting calculator and so on, only starting as a dampening calculator for a hookbill fit.
How to use:
first input the target ships targeting range
second input the amount of dampeners you will activate on it
third put in dampener power DISCLAIMER if you are running a 29% dampenening reduction then flip it to 0.71 in the box
